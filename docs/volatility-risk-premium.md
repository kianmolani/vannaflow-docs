# Volatility Risk Premium

The volatility risk premium represents the reward for bearing an asset's risk. It refers to the fact that, on average, implied (expected) volatility in many asset classes, particularly in indices, is above realized (actual) volatility, indicating options are overpriced over time. Identifying when options are most overpriced creates the opportunity to harvest volatility risk premia systematically.

## Why does it exist?

There are several reasons why implied volatility is upwardly biased:

- The market-making business profits from the bid-ask spread; thus, they are willing to set high quotes to protect their business.
- There is an inherent risk when selling implied volatility because it is insurance on the future, so sellers are expected to be compensated for the risk. It is similar to any general insurance like home or auto insurance, as buyers are willing to pay a premium upfront for protection from future unknown events. But in trading, investors pay for the insurance when they deem it worth hedging their portfolio from potential losses.

## Practical Applications

The volatility risk premium fluctuates over time and reflects investors' risk aversion and tendency to overestimate the probability of significant losses. Its existence alone is not a good enough reason to sell options, but acknowledging its presence creates the opportunity to develop systematic methods to determine when an option is overpriced.

The volatility risk premium is measured through the difference between implied and realized volatility, and its relative value gives the most information. The relative value provides insight into where it sits in its history and is presented within the Volatility Risk Premium chart. Higher readings indicate stable periods in the market but could be a tailwind to future performance, and lower readings indicate uncertainty and risk but could be a tailwind on a bearish market.
