# Volatility Risk Premium

The volatility risk premium refers to the fact that, on average, implied (expected) volatility in many asset classes, particularly in indices, is above realized (actual) volatility, indicating options are overpriced over time. Identifying when options are most overpriced creates the opportunity to harvest premia.

## Why does it exist?

There are several reasons why implied volatility is upwardly biased:

- The market-making business profits from the bid-ask spread; hence, they are willing to set high quotes as insurance on their forecast.
- An inherent risk premium is associated with selling implied volatility because it is insurance on the future. So it is only fair that sellers are compensated for the risk. It is similar to any general insurance like home or auto insurance, as buyers are willing to pay a premium upfront for protection from unknown events in the future. In trading, investors are the ones paying for the insurance when they think it is worth hedging their portfolio from potential losses.

## How do you identify it?

The existence of the volatility risk premium alone is not a good enough reason to sell options. But acknowledging its presence creates the opportunity to develop systematic methods to determine when an option is too expensive.
